<p>A new lighting industry concept- open knowledge and shared data.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;It’s going to take a lot of work to get this site and database up and running, so please bear with the process. The goal is to provide information that reinforces everyone’s knowhow on lighting, and also provide helpful references- like a database of manufacturer products for easy research into finding the right product for you in an unbiased environment. Gigawhatt is happy to entertain partnerships such as the sharing of information from a manufacturer to aid in the process, but starts as a plan to provide impartial data and educational tools.</p>
<p>Think of this more like a proof of concept- chances are the format with which the original idea of this site will be based is inefficient/not fit for a large scale application.</p>
