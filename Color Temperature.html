<h3 class="beegtext">Color Temperature - Things to consider&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
      <p class="colortext">Many folks used to old bulbs that used incandescent/halogen/fluorescent technology to operate may not be aware of exactly what color temperature is, as things like standard house bulbs weren't sold making much mention to this.  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="colortext">Color temperature is a measurement used to describe the hue of a specific type of light source, expressed in degrees Kelvin (K). It relates to the visual warmth or coolness of the light emitted by a source, and it plays a crucial role in various fields, including photography, film, interior design, and general lighting design.&nbsp;The dawning of LEDs has made it possible to have the same light come in a variety of color temperatures to meet any wants or needs of the buyer. </p>
      <ul class="ctlist colorchart">
        <li><strong>The Nostalgia Zone (Below 2700K):</strong> Bulbs in this area of color temperature typically exist to replicate the look of some of the first light bulbs invented or a similar design.&nbsp; Original Edison bulbs would have been somewhere around 2200K-2400K. Candlelight itself lies around 1900K-2200K.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm White (2700K - 3000K):</strong> Similar to traditional incandescent bulbs, this light has a cozy, inviting feel often used in homes. Incandescent bulbs typically were 2700K, while halogen burned a bit hotter, and emitted light closer to 3000K. If you've ever purchased something like GE's Relaxâ„¢ lineup of LED bulbs, popular on department store shelves, these are all in 2700K.</li>
        <li><strong>Neutral White (3500K - 4100K):</strong> A balance between warm and cool, suitable for kitchens and bathrooms. &nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>Cool White (5000K - 6500K):</strong> Mimics daylight and has a bluish tint, often used in offices and retail spaces to promote alertness and focus.</li>

<p class="colortext"><em class="colortext">Perception Can Be Reality!&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<strong class="colortext"> Warm light&nbsp;</strong>
<p class="colortext"> (low Kelvin) is generally perceived as comforting and is often used in residential settings to create inviting atmospheres. It can reduce visual fatigue and create a relaxing environment. </p>
<p class="colortext"><strong>Cool light</strong> (high Kelvin) tends to be more energizing and is preferred for work environments where clarity and concentration are essential. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="colortext">The choice of color temperature can significantly affect mood and perception in a space. For instance, restaurants might favor warmer lighting to create a comfortable dining experience, while hospitals may use cooler lighting for a more sterile and alert environment.</p>
